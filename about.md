I am a passionate Data Scientist who pursues a Ph.D. besides his business work.
Originally I studied pure Mathematics in Germany and Spain.
As a result of an obsession with [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com){: rel="nofollow"} competitions I became familiar with the Machine Learning field.

My fascination with computers and technology in general started at an early age.
I began playing around with java and html.
Fortunately - because of several developer jobs in my career path the eternal learning quest is still not completed.

My research interests are mostly related to Statistics, Machine Learning and the parts of Computer Science that relate to Machine Learning such as Distributed Computing, Machine Learning Architectures etc.
I am dedicated to research things that have the potential to generate business value and with it a real world impact.
The application should not be seen as a necessary section that one needs to get a paper approved but as the main motivation behind the research.

When I am not busy crunching numbers I love to travel and to read.
If it is going well, I do both together ;-).
Further one could call me a sport addict as I do regularly boxing, cycling, snowboarding etc.
