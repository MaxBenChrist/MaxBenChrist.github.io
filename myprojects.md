## tsfresh

Data Scientists spend a significant amount of time on building features which are certain characteristics or patterns in the inspected data. This is especially true for timely annotated data such as time series and sequences. Now, tsfresh frees your time spend on building features by extracting them automatically. It is a python package that allows the automatic extraction of relevant features from time series.
