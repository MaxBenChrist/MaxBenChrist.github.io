Hello internet and welcome to my blog.

![A friendly waving bear ](http://49.media.tumblr.com/a9308a69b396b5f809653d63ec56eb56/tumblr_n2xc3cHWg01sgl0ajo1_500.gif){:rel="nofollow"}

In the near future I will use this blog to write about things that I find interesting and/or useful.
The topics will be mostly related to Statistics, Data Science, Machine Learning and Programming in general.

As [Jonathan Rosenberg](https://googleblog.blogspot.de/2009/02/from-height-of-this-place.html) wrote in an Email to Google Employees in 2009

*"Data is the sword of the 21st century, those who wield it well, the Samurai."*

With this quote in mind, one could say that my future posts will contain knowledge that will help to sharpen the data slashing sword welded by brave data scientists.
