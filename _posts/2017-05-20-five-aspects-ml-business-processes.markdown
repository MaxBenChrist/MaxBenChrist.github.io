As the buzzwords Big Data, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Data Science are on everybody lips, I am more and more often approached by friends to discuss the potential of Machine Learning for their line of work.

For someone without Data Science experience it can be hard to judge where Machine Learning or AI techniques can generate business value. So, in the following, I will sketch five characteristics of business processes that are worthy to be enhanced by ML.

### Everything in a business can be expressed as business process

So first of all, what is a business process? According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process){:rel="nofollow"} it is

*"A business process or business method is a collection of related, structured activities or tasks that produce a specific service or product (serve a particular goal) for a particular customer or customers.".*

So basically, everything that happens in a business is a business process. That is easy. When I think about a business process, I visualize a flow chart, similar to this diagram

Even though the press sometimes talks about AI taking over all walks of live, I feel that Machine Learning in the near future will be most beneficial to enhance existing business processes.

There are some applications like autonomous driving or the google translator app that are disruptive and create totally new value chains, but the majority of applications/startups is based on existing business cases. So, how can one find business areas that are worthy to be enhanced the holy AI grail?

Let us start with some examples where AI already creates value.

### Examples for successful applications of ML

If we visualize a business process as a flowcharts of decision, then machine learning should be used to automate one or multiple decisions in that process. Examples are

1.    Replenishment systems. Forecasts about the demand can be used to anticipate future sales and order accordingly, reducing out of stock situations, waste while keeping stock low.

2.    Optimization of service routes based on failure predictions. One can use forecasts about failures in the near future to assign service schedules and routes not based on intervalls (as in common maintenance) but based on the individual usage and risk profile.

3.    Classification of mails that contain spam.

4.    Personalized marketing. Such techniques are used to tailer promotions or discounts to a clients profile.

5.    Detection of fraudulent transactions.

There are somethings that all those solutions have in common. They fulfill are five conditions

### Five conditions to apply Machine Learning

Those are all decisions that can be enhanced by ML. So, what do those business cases have in common? They fulfill five important characteristics:

**Uncertainty in the optimal decision:** If the business process is already deterministic, then there is no needs to deploy ML to automate it. For example in 1. it is not clear how much the customers will buy while in 3. it is not clear if a mail is spam or not.

**Lots of small/micro decisions and not big decisions:** An unfitting example for a ML process would be the decision when to start a global sale. This stands in contrast to lots of small decisions such as which product to put on sale versus. Also you could automate which customers to send marketing material, like in 4. So we need „small“ business processes that are frequently made. So, focus on operational and not strategic decisions.

**Direct impact:** Only when the ML predictions/decisions are automatically used and the algorithm can directly control the flow of the process, this is real value generated. This is an requirement on both a technical level as well as on an organizational level. So to gain business value, you have to automate!! Otherwise you get stuck with one time improvements or analysis.

**Continuous patterns:** There should historic data about how the old business processes went. Otherwise models can not be trained (for non ML people: training  describes the process of developing a ML system). So if you do not track old business processes, you are done.

**Evidence:** The input should be internally linked to the optimal decision. This can only be checked by analyzing the data. For example in a predictive Maintenance case, it could be that 80% of all failures are not predictable and occur spontaneous. In such a case ML can not be used to optimize the service routing like in 3. You can often only check this condition by looking at the data. So there should be a meaningful input on which the BP can be optimized. Also, it could be that very related business cases are behaving totally differently. E.g. in the case of a replenishment system, one could predict on a week bases but not on a day base.

So, checking those five conditions will give you an basic understanding if your business process can be enhanced by ML techniques.

### Of course there is more

Of course there is a huge range of success factors that determine if AI will generate value for you. E.g. you need a good Change Management to accompany the revoltion, you need a platform to run your softwore on and so on.

Also,

*"optimizing a failing process make you only fail harder“.*

so if you are still in the business of renting VHS or DVDs, I am sorry, no algorithm will help you. If your business model is seriously flawed, no data or algorithm can save you.


So, what do you think about those five aspects? Did I miss a key point?
